# WMAD-Final-Project
Objective: We have learned how to use HTML, CSS, SASS and JavaScript to create websites that
are beautiful, responsive and dynamic. In this final task, our goal is to put these skills into use to
create a website that we can show as part of our portfolio.

1) Read quality resources to get an idea about what should you include in your portfolio
website. Here are some guides:

2) Create detailed wireframes for your website (using some software or by-hand). Indicate
width, length, color, font-size, font-family and other details of your design on the
wireframes.
3) Make an effort to follow HTML5 standards.
4) Use SASS features as you see fit.
5) Use JavaScript as you see fit.
6) Use frameworks like Bootstrap as you see fit.
7) Make sure you understand your code!
8) Validate your code at this link: https://validator.w3.org/
